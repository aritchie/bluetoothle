[feature] macOS support
[feature][all] Connection configuration allows you to set connection priority, notification states on iOS, tvOS, macOS, and whether or not to make the connection persistent
[feature][macos/tvos/ios] Background mode via CBCentralInitOptions - On the platform project use BleAdapter.Init(BleAdapterConfiguration)
[feature][ios] Background - Adapter.WhenDeviceStateRestored() will allow to hook for background state restoration (must be used in conjunction with BleAdapter.Init)
[feature][uwp][droid] Reliable write transaction via Device.BeginReliableWriteTransaction() and GattReliableWriteTransaction
[feature][uwp][droid] WriteBlob now uses reliable write transactions
[feature] Adapter.GetPairedDevices() - pretty self explanatory
[breaking][feature] RequestMtu now returns as an observable with what the accepted MTU was
[breaking] CreateConnection is gone - created more issues than it solved - Use Connect() as it creates persistent connections out of the gate
[breaking] Disconnect has been renamed to CancelConnection as it cancels any pending connections now
[breaking] Logging is gone.  It just isn't needed in light of all of the top level events
[fix][droid] disconnect on existing connection tries
[fix][droid] more gatt 133 issues
[fix][all] Blob write observable subscriptions not firing properly
[fix][all] NotifyEncryptionRequired, Indicate, and IndicateEncryptionRequired return true for CanNotify

1.3
[fix][droid] descriptors and characteristic read/writes now adhere to AndroidConfig.WriteOnMainThread
[fix][ios] WhenStatusChanged was causing OnError when a connection failure occurred
[fix][core] BlobWrite will now use proper MTU
[breaking][feature][core] Background scan has been replaced.  The normal scan now takes a configuration.
[feature][core] Get current MTU size
[feature][droid] monitor MTU changes

1.2
[feature] ability to open bluetooth settings configuration
[feature] ability to request MTU is now part of device (still only available on droid - but allows for greater flexibility)
[feature][droid] ability to pair with a device
[feature][droid] ability to toggle bluetooth adapter status

1.1
[BREAKING] Characteristic/Descriptor Read, Write, and Notification events now return CharacteristicResult that includes the sender characteristic as well as the data
[fix][droid] Write was not broadcasting completion at the right time

1.0.8
[fix] completion of ReadUntil

1.0.7
[feature] IGattCharacteristic.ReadUntil(endBytes) extension method will read in a loop until end bytes detected
[feature][droid] AndroidConfig.MaxTransmissionUnitSize (MTU) can now be set to negotiate MTU upon connections

1.0.6
[fix][droid] write on main thread (can use AndroidConfig.WriteOnMainThread = false, to disable)
[feature] Blob write
[feature] Logging now has deviceconnected/devicedisconnected if you wish to monitor just one of the status'

1.0.5
[fix] ability to check for true WriteNoResponse flags
[fix][droid] ship proper unsubscribe bytes

1.0.4
[fix] logging cleanup
[feature][core] add logging abilities from device reference
[feature][droid] add improved way to deal with Android connection issues (please read docs under Android Troubleshooting)

1.0.3

[droid] device.whenstatuschanged will now broadcast Connecting/Disconnecting
[droid] advertisement packet now gets all service UUIDs parsed

0.9.7
[fix] Error notifications on read/writes
[fix] Make sure to replay last status for connectable observables
[fix] Service discovery on iOS and Android was not registering subsequent subscriptions properly
